# Skripts

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to my Git Repository! I post skripts that I've made and also what the community has made and submitted here!

Some skripts might just be for fun, but some are made for helping some servers (Example: LightEssentials adds basic essentials commands)!
There will also be some games too! When someone submits there skript, I'll review it and check on the internet to see if there not stealing it from someone else, finally I will upload it and name it "YourName - TheSkriptName"!

Occasionally I will come on just to update, add, review, or remove skripts incase I find out they stole the skript and didnt ask permission to share it and claim it as yours!

To request your skript to be added, just clone the repository and add your skript file to the cloned repository, after that make a pull request and tell me why you want your skript added.
